# Maternal Health Monitoring App: MVP Vision

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) vision for the Maternal Health Monitoring App, focusing on addressing the core anxiety and information gap experienced by first-time pregnant mothers.

## 1. Problem Statement

Pregnant mothers, especially those in their first pregnancy, often experience high levels of anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about whether their symptoms (e.g., fatigue, nausea, cramping) are normal or require medical attention. They lack a single, easily accessible, and trustworthy digital space to securely log their vital health metrics (weight, symptoms, mood) and receive reassuring, week-specific educational content.

**The MVP solves this specific pain point:** Providing a secure, private, and simple daily check-in tool that tracks self-reported metrics and delivers curated, just-in-time information to reduce health-related anxiety.

## 2. Primary User Persona

### The Anxious New Mother (Samantha, 30)

* **Mindset:** Focused primarily on the safety and health of the baby. Highly motivated to track data but is easily overwhelmed by the volume of conflicting information online (Dr. Google). She craves reassurance, simplicity, and personalized relevancy (e.g., "What does this symptom mean for my specific week?").
* **Needs:** A non-judgmental, secure digital journal for symptoms and metrics; clear, weekly guidance; and easy visualization of her progress to share with her partner or physician.

## 3. Emotional Goals & Tone

The app's experience must prioritize emotional safety and clarity.

| Category | Goal | UX Principles |
|----------|------|---------------|
| **Tone** | Supportive, Reassuring, Non-Clinical, and Empowering. Avoid alarmist language. | Use encouraging microcopy and positive reinforcement messages ("Great job checking in today!"). |
| **Aesthetics** | Calming, Trustworthy, and Accessible. | Use a soft, non-saturated color palette (e.g., soft blues, greens, neutrals). Ensure high contrast and large, legible typography. |
| **UX** | Extremely simple, single-focus navigation. Minimize decision fatigue. | All core actions (Logging, Viewing Progress, Reading Content) must be accessible within two taps from the home screen. |

## 4. Success Criteria (MVP-Level)

Success for the MVP will be measured by retention and active usage, indicating the app has become a daily habit.

1. **Retention:** Achieve 5,000 Active Users (defined as logging in at least once) within the first 30 days of release.
2. **Daily Habit Score:** Maintain an Average Daily Check-in Rate of 50% (percentage of active users who complete the daily log).
3. **Engagement Depth:** 75% of Active Users log at least one symptom, weight, or mood entry per week.
4. **User Satisfaction:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of > 30 based on in-app feedback surveys.

## 5. Constraints

The following constraints are critical for ensuring a focused and timely MVP delivery:

* **Content Scope Limitation:** Content is limited strictly to the First Trimester (Weeks 1 through 12). Subsequent trimesters will be addressed in future releases.
* **No External Integrations:** The MVP will not integrate with any third-party devices (e.g., smart scales, blood pressure monitors, wearables). All data must be manually input by the user.
* **No Physician Portal:** There will be no functionality for sharing data directly with a doctor or health provider in this release. Data export/sharing is limited to a simple user-generated PDF summary.
* **Platform:** Initial launch is focused on a single platform (e.g., Web App/iOS/Android determined by market analysis).
